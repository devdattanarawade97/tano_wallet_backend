# Tano Telegram Bot  
**Project Documentation: AI Integration and Secure Document Processing**  

---

## **Workflow Overview**  
The Tano Telegram Bot project is designed to integrate cutting-edge technologies like **OpenAI**, **Google Gemini AI**, **TON Blockchain**, and **Pinata** for secure document processing and AI-driven query resolution. Users can interact via a Telegram bot to upload documents (PDF/CSV), submit queries, or send images, receiving AI-generated responses. Document storage is decentralized via Pinata, and transactions are verified on the TON blockchain. Notifications are sent to users after key events like document processing or payment confirmation.

---

### **Key Components and Functionalities**

---

#### **1. AI Model Integrations**
This system integrates two AI models:

- **OpenAI**:  
   - Uses models like `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `text-embedding-3-small` for generating text embeddings and responding to user queries.  
   - Analyzes document content and answers text-based queries.

- **Google Gemini AI**:  
   - Responsible for parsing image uploads and generating descriptive text.  
   - Supports both image and text completions to enhance query resolution for diverse file types.

---

#### **2. Pinata Services Integration**  
**Pinata** is used for decentralized document storage on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):  

- **Document Upload**: Securely uploads PDF/CSV files.  
- **IPFS Storage**: Ensures decentralized and secure file storage using IPFS.  
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure interaction with Pinata services.

---

#### **3. Telegram Bot Integration**  
The **Telegram Bot** serves as the primary interaction point for users, handling notifications, document queries, and transaction updates:  

- **Notifications**: Alerts users about transaction status, document processing results, and AI query responses.  
- **User Interactions**: Facilitates document queries and sends AI-generated responses.  
- **Transaction Updates**: Informs users about transaction status updates from the TON blockchain.

---

#### **4. Document Processing**  
The system processes both **PDF** and **CSV** file formats, extracting and chunking text for AI embedding generation:

- **PDF Processing**:  
   - Uses the `pdfreader` library to extract text from uploaded PDF files.  
   - Text chunks of 2000 characters are created for embedding generation.

- **CSV Processing**:  
   - The `xlsx` library parses CSV files and converts tabular data into textual format.  
   - The processed text is divided into chunks for embedding generation.

---

#### **5. Embedding Generation and Text Chunking**  
- **Text Chunking**: The extracted document content is divided into smaller chunks of 2000 characters.  
- **Embedding Generation**: OpenAI models generate vector representations for each chunk.  
- **Cosine Similarity**: When a user submits a query, cosine similarity is calculated between the query embedding and document embeddings to retrieve the most relevant chunks.

---

#### **6. Transaction Management and TON Blockchain**  
The system integrates with the **TON Blockchain** to handle and verify transactions:

- **Transaction Confirmation**: The system retrieves transaction details using the transaction hash, verifying payment status.  
- **Transaction Notifications**: Users are notified via the Telegram bot once a transaction is confirmed.

---

### **API Endpoints**

---

#### **1. /notify-transaction**  
- Notifies users about transaction statuses using GPT or Gemini for message generation.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/notify-transaction \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "transactionId": "12345",
    "userId": "67890",
    "status": "completed",
    "msgText": "Sample message",
    "model": "gpt"
}'
```

#### **2. /parse-image**  
- Processes an uploaded image with Google Gemini and sends a description back to the user.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/parse-image \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "userId": "12345",
    "imageUri": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    "imageMimeType": "image/jpeg"
}'
```

#### **3. /confirm-transaction**  
- Confirms a transaction on the TON blockchain by parsing the BOC (Bag of Cells).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/confirm-transaction \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "boc": "boc data here"
}'
```

#### **4. /update-lastused**  
- Updates the user's last activity and notifies them via Telegram.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/update-lastused \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "telegramUserName": "john_doe",
    "chatId": "123456789"
}'
```

### **Document Embedding and Querying Process**

---

**Step 1: File Upload and Text Extraction**  
Users upload a PDF or CSV file, the system extracts text, chunks it, and generates embeddings.

**Step 2: Embedding Storage**  
Generated embeddings are stored in memory (future iterations may involve database storage for larger documents).

**Step 3: User Query and Chunk Retrieval**  
User submits a query via the Telegram bot, and cosine similarity is used to retrieve relevant text chunks from stored embeddings.

**Step 4: AI Response**  
The retrieved chunks are passed to OpenAIâ€™s GPT model, generating a response, which is sent back to the user via the Telegram bot.

---

### **Bot Commands**

---

1. **/start**: Initializes the bot and prompts the user to connect their wallet.  
2. **/text**: Sends a text query and allows the user to choose between Gemini or GPT modes.  
3. **/image**: Requests image upload, which is processed via Google Gemini AI.  
4. **/docs**: Requests PDF/CSV uploads for document processing and querying.  
5. **/update**: Updates an existing file in Pinata.  
6. **/hey**: Queries a document uploaded by another user, based on available embeddings.

---

### **Error Handling**

---

- **API Errors**: Logged and fallback messages sent to users.  
- **File Processing Errors**: Errors during text extraction are logged for debugging.  
- **AI Model Errors**: Issues during embedding generation or AI completions are handled to maintain stability.

---

### **Environment Variables**

- **TOKEN**: Telegram bot token  
- **PVT_KEY**: Private key for blockchain interactions  
- **OPEN_API_KEY**: OpenAI API key  
- **GEMINI_API_KEY**: Google Gemini API key  
- **PINATA_JWT**: Pinata authentication token  
- **PINATA_GETWAY**: Pinata IPFS gateway
